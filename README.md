# Reinforcement Learning Exercises
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for projects and exercises from the textbook [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction second edition](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). The aim is to document and share my learning journey, including solutions to textbook exercises, implementation of key algorithms, and various reinforcement learning projects.
